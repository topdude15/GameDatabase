# GameDatabase
 
Team: Trevor Rose and TJ Juarez

Finding games online is currently difficult and segmented.  Each platform has their own store, and oftentimes you canâ€™t access that information through your web browser but only through the platform itself.  This is the problem that our database will solve.  We will store all of the information about a variety of video games across all platforms that can be accessed online so that users can search for any game.  The database will also store information regarding details of the game, such as its publisher, rating, and reviews.  It will also publicly track players along with their rankings in games with ranked leaderboards.
